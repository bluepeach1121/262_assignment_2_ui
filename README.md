# Design assignment 2

`you are required to design and simulate a simplified digital roulette game using Verilog HDL.
The roulette board consists of 38 positions: numbers 0 through 36, and "00", which should be represented internally as the
number 37.
A single player begins with a total of $100 and is allowed to place bets on one or more of these positions before each round.
For every bet, the player will specify both the position (using a 6-bit input) and the bet amount (using an 8-bit input).
Once all bets are placed, the round begins, and the system should generate a pseudo-random winning number between 0
and 37 (37 being 00). If the player placed a bet on the winning number, they receive 36 times the amount they wagered on
that number; all other bets are considered losses.
`

**This implementation is in python.. we used python Tkinter library to make  working UI to get the bonus points.**
